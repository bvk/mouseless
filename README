* About this Extension

This GreaseMonkey extension enables internet browsing without the
mouse. Currently, only Google Chrome browser is supported.

* How to use this Extension

If this extension is enabled, users should notice a small number -- as a
superscript -- after every link. When users type that number and press enter
key, this extension opens the corresponding link. Some salient feaures are:

- Ctrl+Enter opens the link in a new tab

* Known Issues

- This doesn't seem to work on webpages with flash content.
- It seems AJAX content that is loaded later doesn't get the navigation
  numbers.
- Link numbers seem to get messed up when you returned to a webpage using the
  back button.

* TODO

- What more?
